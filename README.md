All models are from "Skit-Learn"
We need a machine learning model that can accurately estimate the relationship between speed and the rates. As you may remember, the regression model is not accurate enough, so we need a more advanced model (we need a model that passes through almost all the data points as shown in your graph).
In case of Neural Network, you can apply many more available models
All uploaded models are applied on some small sample dataset. we have to reorganize the whole dataset and then modify the uploaded models.  there are 2 approaches:

(1) One model for each class: 

Interpolation - Cubic splines
Kernel Smoothing/Regression
Support Vector Regression
Random Forest

(2) one general model for all classes:
 
Random Forest
Gradient boosting (XGBOOST, LightBoost, CAtboost)
Neural Network
